# House Price Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (Regression)
## Overview
This project revolves around using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict house prices. Predicting housing prices is crucial in real estate, aiding buyers, sellers, and agents in making informed decisions about property transactions. ANNs offer a powerful tool for comprehending complex relationships within housing data to forecast prices.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build an effective predictive model using ANNs that can accurately estimate house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant factors.

## Data
The dataset utilized in this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). It contains various features related to houses such as square footage, number of bedrooms, geographical location, and sale prices. This dataset provides a rich source of information for training and evaluating the predictive model.

## Methodology
The project uses an Artificial Neural Network for regression. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and possibly perform feature engineering to enhance model performance. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets. The ANN model architecture is designed, trained on the training set, and evaluated using the testing set to assess its predictive performance.

## Results
The model's performance metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared, will be reported in the notebook. Interpretation of the results will help in understanding the model's predictive capability and its accuracy in estimating house prices.
